    directive: |
      Design a comprehensive test to evaluate the effectiveness of a condensed prompt. Output the design as commented Ruby code.
    backdrop: |
      Consider various aspects of prompt effectiveness, including clarity, completeness, and ability to elicit desired responses. Leverage Ruby's capabilities for string manipulation, data structuring, and test automation in your commented code design.
    instruction: |
      Follow these steps to design a test for the condensed prompt, represented as commented Ruby code:
      1. **Analyze the condensed prompt:**
         ```ruby
         # condensed_prompt = "Write a short story about a cat." 
         # keywords = condensed_prompt.split(" ") # Extract keywords 
         # intended_outcome = "A short story narrative featuring a cat as a central character." # Infer intended outcome
         ```
      2. **Develop test cases:**
         ```ruby
         # test_cases = [
         #   { prompt: "Write a story about a cat.", expected_output: "Narrative with a cat", edge_case: false },
         #   { prompt: "Cat story", expected_output: "Narrative with a cat", edge_case: true }, # Minimal prompt
         #   # ... more test cases
         # ]
         ```
      3. **Create a rubric:**
         ```ruby
         # rubric = {
         #   "clarity" => { 5 => "Excellent", 4 => "Good", 3 => "Fair", 2 => "Poor", 1 => "Very Poor" },
         #   "completeness" => { 5 => "Fully addresses prompt", 1 => "Fails to address prompt" },
         #   # ... more criteria
         # }
         ```
      4. **Design control prompts:**
         ```ruby
         # original_prompt = "Write a creative and engaging short story about a cat who goes on an adventure."
         # minimally_altered_prompt = "Write a short story about a cat's adventure." 
         ```
      5. **Specify the test environment:**
         ```ruby
         # api_endpoint = "your_model_api_endpoint"
         # api_key = "your_api_key"
         # model_parameters = { temperature: 0.7, max_tokens: 200 } 
         ```
      6. **Create evaluator instructions (optional):**
         ```ruby
         # evaluator_instructions = <<~INSTRUCTIONS
         #   Please evaluate the responses based on the following criteria:
         #   - Clarity: How clear and understandable is the generated story?
         #   - Completeness: Does the story fully address the prompt and provide a satisfying narrative?
         #   # ... more instructions
         # INSTRUCTIONS
         ```
      7. **Develop metrics:**
         ```ruby
         # def calculate_quality_score(response, rubric)
         #   # ... logic to calculate quality score based on rubric
         # end

         # def task_completion(response, expected_output)
         #   # ... logic to determine if the task was completed successfully 
         # end 
         ```
      8. **Outline a procedure for statistical analysis:**
         ```ruby
         # # Use Statistics2 library to perform t-tests or ANOVA to compare 
         # # the performance of the condensed prompt against control prompts. 
         ```
      9. **Implement the test (not shown here):** 
         # This would involve using libraries like HTTParty to make API calls, 
         # JSON to parse responses, and iterating through test cases.
      10. **Report findings (not shown here):**
         # This would involve summarizing results and insights in a report,
         # potentially using a templating library like ERB.
